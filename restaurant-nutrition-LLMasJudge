Looking at this Restaurant-Nutrition microservices application specification, I would 
rate the implementation complexity as **4 out of 5 (Hard)**.
Here's my analysis of the complexity factors:

**High Complexity Elements (Contributing to the 4 rating):**

1. **Multi-service Architecture**: Four interconnected microservices requiring proper 
    service-to-service communication and coordination
2. **Authentication & Authorization**: Token-based auth system with validation across 
    services, plus privileged user handling
3. **External API Integration**: Integration with Ninja API for nutritional data, 
   including error handling for external service failures
4. **Complex Business Logic**: 
   - Nutritional calculations (summing ingredient values)
   - Diet matching algorithms (comparing dish nutrition to user profiles)
   - Rating aggregation and average calculations
5. **Database Operations**: Full CRUD operations across multiple MongoDB collections 
   with proper data modeling
6. **Error Handling**: Comprehensive HTTP status code handling (401, 400, 404, 405, 
  415, 500) across all services
7. **Query Processing**: Complex filtering logic for dishes (nutritional constraints, 
  ingredient matching) and profiles

**Moderate Complexity Elements:**
- Docker containerization requirements
- REST API design and implementation
- Data validation and formatting (2 decimal places for floats)

**Why not a 5 (Extremely Hard):**
- Well-defined specifications with clear requirements
- Standard technologies (Python, MongoDB, REST APIs)
- No real-time processing or complex distributed systems patterns
- No advanced security beyond basic token auth

This is a substantial project that would require solid understanding of microservices 
architecture, database design, API integration, and comprehensive error handling, 
making it challenging but achievable for developers with intermediate to advanced skills.
