Looking at this public library microservices application specification, I 
would rate the complexity as **3 out of 5** (moderate complexity). 
Here's my analysis:
**Factors that keep complexity moderate (not higher):**
- **Clear, well-defined requirements** - The specification is detailed and
    unambiguous
- **Standard CRUD operations** - Most services follow basic Create, Read, 
    Update, Delete patterns
- **Common technology stack** - Python, MongoDB, Docker, REST APIs are 
     well-established
- **Simple data models** - Straightforward JSON documents with basic field 
     types
- **Limited business logic** - Most complexity is in basic calculations 
    (fines, return dates)

**Factors that add complexity:**
- **Inter-service communication** - Services need to call each other 
    (Cardholders → Borrows, Borrows → Logs)
- **External API integration** - Google Books API integration for 
    publisher/date lookup
- **Business rule enforcement** - Preventing borrowing when 2+ books are 
    overdue
- **Date calculations** - Fine calculations based on overdue days, return 
    date computation
- **Error handling** - Proper HTTP status codes and exception handling across services
- **Distributed data consistency** - Ensuring data integrity across multiple services 
    and databases

**Why not higher complexity:**
- No complex algorithms or data processing
- No authentication/authorization requirements
- No real-time or high-performance requirements
- No complex integrations beyond one external API
- No sophisticated business workflows

**Why not lower complexity:**
- Multiple interconnected services require coordination
- Business logic beyond simple CRUD operations
- External dependencies and error scenarios to handle

This falls squarely in the "moderate" category - more complex than a simple single-
service CRUD app, but less complex than enterprise-scale distributed systems with 
complex business logic, security requirements, or performance constraints.
